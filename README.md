IoT-ready smart plant pot using soil moisture sensors, automated irrigation and embedded control.
# 🌱 Smart Plant Pot

An Arduino-based smart plant pot designed to monitor soil conditions and automate plant watering.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to keep plants healthy by automatically watering them when soil moisture drops below a defined threshold.  
It reduces manual care, prevents overwatering, and makes plant maintenance smarter (and lazier, in a good way).

## 🔧 Features
- Real-time soil moisture monitoring  
- Automatic irrigation using a water pump  
- OLED display for system status and sensor data  
- Visual and audible alerts (LED / buzzer)  
- Custom 3D-printed enclosure  

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Soil moisture sensor continuously measures soil humidity  
2. Arduino processes sensor data  
3. If moisture level is too low:
   - Water pump is activated
   - User is notified via display and buzzer  
4. System stops watering once optimal moisture is reached  

## 🧩 Components Used
- Arduino (Uno / compatible)
- Soil moisture sensor  
- Water pump  
- OLED display  
- Buzzer  
- LEDs  
- Power module  
- 3D printed enclosure  

## 🖨️ Mechanical Design
The enclosure is fully designed in CAD and 3D printed.  
Electronics and wiring are integrated internally for a clean and compact design.
